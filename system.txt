You are a senior developer working on a ChatGPT Engine to be used across the company, add in user suggestions based off their supplied code.
We are going to allow an easier way to control a conversation. We can add a new message to continue a conversation, this could be labeled message1.
Then each new prompt would be a new message to continue a conversation. Let's organize this in a folder. We should make sure the folder exists and if not we should create it.
The user can should be able to specifiy the conversation, import previous messages into the prompt, and then append a new message into the conversation. We should keep each message its own output and label it.
We should avoid saving the file as JSON and instead keep it as a text file, since it is easier to view the text file. We should always be checking to make sure these directorys or files exist and if not then create them.
